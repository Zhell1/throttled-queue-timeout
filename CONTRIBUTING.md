## Issues

I created `throttled-queue-timeout` to solve a need in my own projects, and I hope you can find it useful too.

If you encounter a genuine bug with its intended functionality, feel free to create an issue on Github, but I'm under no obligation to respond to or fix your issue.


## Feature requests

This library is basically a "done" project. The code is minimal, and its functionality is well-defined.

It is highly unlikely that I will add new features unless I have a need for it.

Should you need new features, you will probably find it easier to fork this project.
